# Flight Booker App

This project is to make a flight booker app.  It is a learning project, set by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms?ref=lnav).  It's main purpose is to practise advanced forms, including nesting, as well as complex data models.

Since this is an exercise somethings have been done a bit differently than they would in production to get the most out of the exercise, and also to not overly complicate it.

I've used PostgreSQL for dev here so as to be able to take advantage of some custom SQL queries.  So to see this working you need PostgreSQL running on your computer and you need to configure the databases.yml file.  Alternatively you can check out the [live version](https://safe-peak-87499.herokuapp.com).
